<h1>Happy New Year Soni &#x2764;</h1>
<h2>I loved you the moment I saw you. I can not find words to describe the feeling you gave me that day. Your smile, your laughter, your bright eyes – I love everything about you, and my biggest New Year’s wish will be your happiness even if I am with you or not.
<br>You are the only one who I want to kiss on the New Year’s night. Your sweet softness and tenderness make me feel like I have to protect you from all your troubles and difficulties, and I promise you to be the one who always has your back. Have an amazing New Year, Happy 2021 ! &#128158;</h2>
