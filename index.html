<h1>Happy New Year Soni &#x2764;</h1>
<h2>I can not find words to describe the feeling. Your smile, your laughter, your bright eyes, your curly hair  – I love everything about you, and my biggest New Year’s wish will be your happiness even if I am with you or not.
<br> Your sweet softness and tenderness make me feel like I have to protect you from all your troubles and difficulties, and I promise you to be the one who always has your back. A poem written below for you, obviously I didn't wrote it ,I searched it on net ! 😅 Have an amazing New Year, Happy 2021 ! &#128158;</h2>



<h2> Sometimes I feel </h2>

<h2> Like I’m walking on air </h2>

<h2> Other times blankly </h2>

<h2>At a ceiling, I stare</h2>

<h2>Sometimes in the clouds</h2>

<h2>I feel like I want to fly
</h2>
<h2>Touching them with my hands</h2>

<h2>Sometimes I want to try
</h2>
<h2>The world in which I live</h2>

<h2>Is like a dreamlike trance
</h2>
<h2>To be crazily in love with you</h2>

<h2>I’m glad destiny give me the chance</h2>

<h1> I love you soni ❤️ </h1>
